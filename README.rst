Introduction
============

**IBA Studio** is an intuitive graphical user interface designed to complement and enhance the capabilities of `pyIBA <https://github.com/m-sequeira/pyIBA>`_. IBA Studio offers users an accessible and user-friendly environment for conducting Ion Beam Analysis (IBA). This interface streamlines the process of data analysis, making it more efficient and approachable for both novice and expert users. Just like pyIBA, IBA Studio incorporates the NDF code. This integration provides a seamless experience, combining the reliability of pyIBA's core functionalities with the convenience of a graphical interface.

Background
==========

Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) is a suite of powerful techniques with applications spanning materials science, nuclear physics, and biology. Despite its vast potential, the intricacies of managing and analyzing IBA data have often posed challenges. The introduction of the Ion Beam Data Format (IDF) aims at a more efficient data management, aligning with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). This universal format is pivotal for fostering collaboration and ensuring transparency, especially in large-scale European projects such as RADIATE and ReMade@ARI.

IBA Studio:
===========

Features:
---------

- **Graphic User Interface:** IBA Studio offers an intuitive platform for the rapid viewing, editing, and analysis of IDF data, making it more accessible to a broader audience.
- **Unified Data Management:** Facilitates the integration of data from diverse IBA techniques within a singular IDF file.
- **NDF Integration:** Incorporates NDF, a recognized analysis code in the IBA community, enabling simultaneous analysis of varied data. This ensures that all pertinent information, from parameters to results, is consolidated in one location.
- **Future-Proof Design:** A modular development approach ensures adaptability, allowing for the seamless integration of additional codes and tools in the future.
